LOW-LEVEL PROGRAMMING - DATA STRUCTURES, ALGORITHMS, LINUX/UNIX SYSTEM PROGRAMMING(C PROGRAMMING)

iIntroduction
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners. Also C, is a computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by American computer scientist Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T Bell Laboratories).

Table of Contents
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by ALX_Africa. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

0. 0x00. C - Hello, World
It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language
1. 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
It aims to learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in C language
2. 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in C language
3. 0x03. C - debugging
It aims to learn how to debug in C language
4. 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
It aims to learn about nested loops in C language
5. 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in C language
6. 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in C language
7. 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in C language
8. 0x08. C - Recursion
It aims to learn about recursion and how to implement it in C language
9. 0x09. C - Static libraries
It aims to learn about static libraries in C language
10. 0x0A. C - argc, argv
It aims to learn about how to use arguments passed to a program in C language
11. 0x0B. C - malloc, free
It aims to learn about automatic and dynamic allocation in C language
12. 0x0C. C - More malloc, free
It aims to learn about how to use malloc, calloc, realloc and exit functions in C language
13. 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
It aims to learn about how to include guard in the header files and macros in C language
14. 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
It aims to learn about using struct and typedef to create a data structure and non-existing datatype that is made up of some primitive datatypes in C language
15. 0x0F. C - Function pointers
It aims to learn about function pointers in C language
16. 0x10. C - Variadic functions
It aims to learn about writing c functions that take variable number of arguments each time they're called; knowing the use of va_arg, va_start, va_end and const in C language
17. 0x11. C - printf
It aims to learn about how to create our own Printf Function in C language
18. 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
It aims to learn about linked lists in C language
19. 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists
It aims to learn about singly linked lists in C language
20. 0x14-bit_manipulation
It aims to learn about how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C language
21. 0x15-file_io
It aims to learn about how to handle files (open, close, read and write), file descriptors, system calls and file permissions to interact with the kernel and how to use the flags â€” O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR in C language
22. 0x17-doubly_linked_lists
It aims to learn about a more complex form of singly linked list in C language
